# TypeScript

**TypeScript - JavaScript with Type Checking**

**TypeScript is JavaScript with added syntax for types.**

TypeScript is a syntactic superset of JavaScript which adds static typing.

This basically means that TypeScript adds syntax on top of JavaScript, allowing developers to add types.

TypeScript being a "Syntactic Superset" means that it shares the same base syntax as JavaScript, but adds something to it.

### Benefits

- Static typing
- Code completion
- Refactoring
- Shorthand notations

### Drawbacks

- Compilation
- Discipline in coding

### TypeScript Compiler

TypeScript is transpiled into JavaScript using a compiler.

TypeScript being converted into JavaScript means it runs anywhere that JavaScript runs!

TypeScript - Medium to large projects
JavaScript - Simple projects
